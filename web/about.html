            <h2>What is Q-STAR?</h2>
            <p>
                The QR-Based Student Tracking Attendance Recorder (Q-STAR) is a collaborative project for the Filipino 6 
                and Social Science 6 subjects. The initiative is both a research endeavor and a community project designed
                 to primarily benefit the school library’s attendance system.
                The goal is to automate the attendance tracking system of the library using a program that streamlines the 
                library’s attendance system through the implementation of a QR-based scanner. This program will scan a 
                user’s unique QR code displayed on their ID, and utilize that information to efficiently encode their 
                time-in and time-out in the system, together with information such as name, grade level, section, and 
                biological sex. This information can be compiled externally into a CSV file for an organized review 
                of student and library performance.                
            </p>
